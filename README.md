# Saagar_220927_Web3_Project
About the project:

I have done the task using Java.I have tried to implement the task in 3D. I have revised the OOPs concepts in Java and then used them to do this task.
In this project, I have created class Car and declared the data members as mentioned in the task. Extra members are declared to store the co-ordinates and components of velocity of each car. Along with the methods given, a new method change_dir(float,float,float) is also defined to change/give(the initial direction) the direction of a car.
The logic used to calculate time taken to collide is described below:

1)If the relative velocity of the cars is anti-parallel to the relative position , then they will collide if they continue to move in same directions. If they continue to move with same speeds, the time taken = relative position/relative speed.

2)If the relative position is parallel to the relative velocity , they won't collide unless speeds are changed. They actually separate.

3)If the relative position and relative velocity are non-parallel, they won't collide unless directions are changed.
In the main() function,
a sample set of data is used to take a trial of calling the methods.

Motivation for choosing this project:

I want to explore more in the fields of blockchains and their mechanisms. These concepts are appealing to me and I'm quite inquisitive about them. I wish to advance in the process of developing my knowledge about these amazing fields through this project. This has motivated me to choose this project as my preference 1.
